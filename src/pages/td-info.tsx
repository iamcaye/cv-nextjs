                        I began working in 2022 as a Software Developer through an internship provided by my university.
                        Upon completing my internship, my performance was satisfactory, leading to a permanent position.

                        Initially, my role primarily involved learning how to use <strong>Angular 13</strong> and <strong>.NET Core 6</strong> for creating <strong>forms with validations. </strong>
                        During this period, I also had the opportunity to learn about <strong>process automation</strong> and <strong>web scraping</strong>, which proved to be invaluable for data acquisition, 
                        <strong>project testing</strong>, and the development of various scripts to streamline our daily tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Following this phase, I transitioned to a different project that had been ongoing for several years. 
                        This project utilized older technologies, specifically <strong>.NET Framework</strong> and <strong>AngularJS</strong>. 
                        My responsibilities included <strong>implementing new features</strong> and <strong>addressing bugs</strong> in both the frontend and backend. 
                        This project also afforded me the opportunity to directly <strong>engage with the client</strong>, understanding their requirements and 
                        actively participating in decisions regarding the project's direction.

                        Presently, I am part of a different team working on a sales tool for another client. 
                        This project employs more up-to-date technologies, including <strong>Angular 14</strong> and <strong>Express.ts</strong>. 
                        While this project is my current main focus, I still have ongoing tasks related to my previous projects.
