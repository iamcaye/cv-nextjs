                    <p>
                        I started working in 2022 as Software Developer with a internship provided by my university
                        but at the time I finished it they were happy with my work so they hire me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At first my job was to learn to use <b>Angular 13</b> and <b>NET Core 6</b> for making forms with validations,
                        which was the same task I had in my first project. We also got the opportunity to learn about <b>process automation</b> and <b>web scraping</b> in this period,
                        which was very helpful for getting data, <b>making test for the projects</b> and also for making some scripts that helped us in our daily work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that I enter another project that was already started years ago which used <b>NET Framework</b> and <b>AngularJS</b>.
                        I was in charge of making new features and fixing bugs in the frontend and backend. This is the project that made me
                        learn the most and also gave me the opportunity to <b>talk with the client</b>, understand their needs and also help them making decisions about the course of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally I&apos;ve enter into another group that is working on a sale tool for another client. This project is using <b>Angular 15</b> and <b>Express.ts.</b>
                        I still have other tasks with the previous projects but right now this is my main project.
